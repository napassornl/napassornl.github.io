In the summer of 2016, I embarked on a journey to Africa. I was working with the Partnership in Global Health Technologies and 
developing a medical device for the mothers in [Zanzibar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zanzibar+City,+Tanzania/@-6.1659166,38.9224895,10z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x185cd0f3391d3d41:0xdbc20333cc5e4ad5!8m2!3d-6.165917!4d39.202641),
Tanzania. I gain rich a experience in the medical system in Zanzibar and got to connect with the people there. I learned about 
their cultures and their perspectives in the growth of medical device innovation. Though I commited 6 weeks of hard work, my 
colleagues and I managed to find time and explore this beautiful island called Zanzibar.  

Fun fact: Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of Queen was born here!  

Thus, I will start at Freddie's birthplace, Stone Town. As its name indicates, the conglomerate of houses are made from white stone. Mazes
of narrow streets traverse the houses where some are just houses and others are small shops. Like this shop that sells beautiful paintings.

Stone town was were I stayed for the majority, but Zanzibar is has much more in store! Just a taxi drive away, we can take a boat to
go on a safari! We can also go scuba diving and chill on top of a sand dune.

If you go up to the north of the island, you arrive at Nungwi and the boat cruise to see the sunset is just beautiful!

Nungwi is a very long beach. If you keep walking, you get to see the local people fish and find sea shells.

But Nungwi is just too beautiful, so tourism is another popular business here.

In fact, Tanzania has many popular tourism destinations. So now, I would like to take you to the mainland, to Mikumi, Tanzania. I got to
do my first animal safari at Mikumi National Park. Sadly, I didn't see lions, but the other animals are just as amazing!

Of course, I have more photos, but I think this is enough to make you want to travel to Zanzibar and Tanzania to see for yourself! This
was a great experience for me and so I am positive that you won't be disappointed either.
