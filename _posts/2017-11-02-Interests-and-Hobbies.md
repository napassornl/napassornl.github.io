1. **Music**:  
Music is my life, especially 80s music! It may seem cliche but when ever I feel down, music always lifts me up. Although 80s music is 
my favorite, I listen to all types from Kanye West to Taylor Swift to Queen to The Chipmunks. If it's music, I will listen.
2. **Movies and Entertainment**:  
First, have you finished Stanger Things Season 2 yet? If not, DO IT!
Second, have you ever tried Korean cinema, if not DO THIS TOO! I know you have to read the translations, but language is not the barrier here. I find that Korean cinema have more impact on me than movies and series in English. Yes, they are that good. In fact, Netflix has a whole bunch of Korean dramas and movies, like Train to Busan, Descendants of the Sun, and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. Get ready to have the feels!   
I am currently watching a Korean drama called [Go Back Couple](http://asianwiki.com/Go_Back_Couple) aka Confession Couple. It is about a divorced couple that gets to go back in time and relive their life in college, which is where they met each other and fell in love. I like it because it is different. In many movies, the happy endings usually end up with marriage, but with this drama marriage is the beginning to a terrible life and from that you get to see how the couple struggles in their relationship. Getting to see how they will choose to live their lives now when they suddenly travel back in time is very fun and interesting. I highy recommend!
Third, I randomly found this comedy series on buzzfeed called [the Try Guys](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tryguys) and they are hilarious. All their episodes are insightful and fun to watch.
Lastly, it might not seem obivious, but I really love movies. I love talking about how movies make me feel and sometimes vent when a movie is bad. That's why I follow [Screen Junkies](http://www.screenjunkies.com/). I especially enjoy their Honest Trailers!
3. **Photography**:  
I am no expert in photography, but I try to be as artistic as I can when capturing an image. It is most fun when you are exploring the world with friends and capturing those memorable moments. Check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/napassor.n/)!
4. **Yoga**:
When I have time, my go to workout is Yoga because I am not a fan of high impact workouts (mostly, because I am lazy).
