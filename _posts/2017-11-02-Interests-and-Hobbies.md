**Music**:  

Music is my life, especially 80s music! It may seem cliche but when ever I feel down, music always lifts me up. Although 80s music is 
my favorite, I listen to all types from Kanye West to Taylor Swift to Queen to The Chipmunks. If it's music, I will listen.

**Movies and Entertainment**:  

First, have you finished The Crown Season 2 yet? If not, DO IT!  

Second, have you ever tried Korean cinema, if not DO THIS TOO! I know you have to read the translations, but language is not the barrier here. I find that Korean cinema have more impact on me than movies and series in English. Yes, they are that good. In fact, Netflix has a whole bunch of Korean dramas and movies, like Train to Busan, Descendants of the Sun, and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon. Get ready to have the feels!

Lastly, it might not seem obivious, but I really love movies. I love talking about how movies make me feel and sometimes vent when a movie is bad. That's why I follow [Screen Junkies](http://www.screenjunkies.com/). I especially enjoy their Honest Trailers!   

**Photography**:  

I am no expert in photography, but I try to be as artistic as I can when capturing an image. It is most fun when you are exploring the world with friends and capturing those memorable moments. Check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/napassor.n/)!
