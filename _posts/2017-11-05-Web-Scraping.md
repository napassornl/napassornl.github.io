# What is Web Scraping?
Web Scraping is the process of extracting information as text from web pages and putting them in a well-structured tabular format.  

This is a Python program that goes through HTML to extract data from websites. I used BeautifulSoup library to parse throught the HTML code and stored the information in a pandas data table.
