# [Car-Collision-Tracker](https://github.com/napassornl/Car-Collision-Tracker)
This is a class assignment to predicting collisions of a large number of objects moving in a two-dimensional space.
The problem is relevant, for example, to air-traffic control, self-driving cars, or game simulations (asteroids, curling, pool).

# Physical Model
## Starting Scenario
My task was to designed C++ Algorithm to anticipate and model car object collisions given starting scenario of object ID, 
initial location, and velocity coordinates. The vehicles are specified in a file which gives an ID, a location at time t = 0
(x/y coordinates in meters) and velocity (x/y coordinates, in meters/second).

Here is an example of the file format:  
2MU133 -34.94 -69.13 0.468 -0.900  
0WI913 -43.08 92.12 -0.811 -0.958  
6UP738 2.97 -66.25 -0.077 0.074  
1IA244 72.94 -86.02 -0.665 -0.283  
8RT773 -32.25 -2.63 -0.797 0.628  
0HV350 -73.97 24.21 0.960 -0.870  
0DU118 -82.09 44.95 0.661 -0.343  
4FA522 -18.20 72.32 0.734 -0.990  
1WR684 31.71 68.89 -0.509 -0.706  

## Motion Model
The vehicles travel on a two-dimensional surface called the “field”. Each vehicle travels in a straight line at a constant velocity. The direction of travel is the direction of the velocity vector. Each vehicle will continue travelling in this direction forever, unless it collides with another vehicle.

## Collision Model
Two vehicles collide at the moment the distance between them becomes equal to the collision distance. For this problem, the collision distance is defined as 10 meters. When two vehicles collide, they are vaporized and are removed from the field. All other vehicles continue. My task was to discover all collisions, in the order that they occur, and determine the surviving vehicles. Time did not exist before t = 0, so if two vehicles would have collided in the past, we ignore this event. It never happened.

# My Output Format
The first line should specify how many vehicles there are.

Here is the correct output for the input file random10.coordinates:  
there are 10 vehicles  
collision report  
at 18.0547 8RT773 collided with 0HV350  
at 33.8258 4FA522 collided with 1WR684  
the remaining vehicles are  
2MU133 -34.94 -69.13 0.468 -0.9  
0WI913 -43.08 92.12 -0.811 -0.958  
6UP738 2.97 -66.25 -0.077 0.074  
1IA244 72.94 -86.02 -0.665 -0.283  
0DU118 -82.09 44.95 0.661 -0.343  
7SW673 41.29 42.68 0.549 -0.012
