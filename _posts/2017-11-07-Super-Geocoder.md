# [Super GeoCoder](https://github.com/napassornl/Super-GeoCoder)

Super GeoCoder is an application that allows the user to upload a file with a table format that stores a list of address to the browser. The user clicks the Submit button and the browser will
display the table along with two new columns of the latitude and longitude corresponding to the address in each column. Then, the user is able to download the table as a .csv file.
