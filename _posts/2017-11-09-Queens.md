# What is the Eight Queens Puzzle?
It is a problem of placing 8 chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no queens can attack one another. It was devised in 1848 by chess composer Max Bezzel and Franz Nauck published the first solutions in 1850. According to the rules of chess, the queen is the most powerful piece in the game because it is able to move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Thus, in this puzzle, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.   

Here's one solution:

# Now try and play the game!
Download the executable file from my [Github](https://github.com/napassornl/Chess-Game).  
Note: This desktop application was built in C#.NET and so it will only work with Windows OS.  

# My Application Specs
A left click on a cell places a queen if there isn't one there already and if it is a safe cell (one that if a queen is placed there it can't be captured by any queen already on the board). If it is not a safe cell, a sound will notify you.  

If you made a mistake, a right click on a cell with a removes the queen and ignores other actions if there is no queen on the cell.  

There is a count of the numbers of queens placed on teh chess board shown so you can keep track of your queens. 

If you want to start over, click on the Clear button to reset the chessboard.

If you were able to solve it, a message will be displayed. Awesome job!

But there is more...if you are a beginner, there is an feature for playing the game with hints. If you check the Hints box, the program will guide you into selecting the correct cells because this time all unsafe cells will be colored in red!
