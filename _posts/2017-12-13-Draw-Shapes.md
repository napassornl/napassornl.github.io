Download the Program [here.](https://github.com/napassornl/Draw-Shapes)  

Note: The program was created as a Windows Form Application using C#.NET and so can only be used on a Windows OS.

# How to Draw  
This is a simple drawing program that allows users to draw lines, rectangles, and/or ellipses. The user chooses what shape to draw in the draw panel.  

The user draws the shape with two mouse clicks on the white panel. The two mouse clicks set the invisible boundaries of the box containing the object. The user can click on any two opposite corners of the box, not just upper left and lower right.  

The user can specify the details of each shape by clicking the Settings Button, which will open a dialog box. The user can specify the width and color of the line or border of the rectangle and ellipse. Also, for rectangle and ellipse shapes, the user can adjust the fill color by checking the fill checkbox and choosing a fill color as shown:

# How to Edit and Save
The menustrip on the top bar of the window allows the user to undo his/her drawing or clear the drawing panel entirely.  

The user can also save his/ her work by selecting the Save tab. The user can save in many formats such as Jpeg, Png, Tiff, and Gif.  

Here is an example of a simple (but not as pretty) drawing saved as a Jpeg file from the program:
