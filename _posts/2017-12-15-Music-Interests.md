*Here's some music I can't get enough of:* 


## Boy with Luv by BTS
They are the biggest boy band in the world! Though how they got there was not easy. It took them over 7 years of diligence and passion to follow their dreams and tell their sincere stories through music they produced and wrote. They remain humble and and hard working in their career and are an inspirations to millions of people around the world.

## This is how you feel by Loote
Another hard working group. I honestly love all of the duo's song.
