*Here's some music I can't get enough of lately:* 
  

### Boy with Luv by BTS
They are the biggest boy band in the world! Though their journey was not an easy one. It took them over 7 years diligently and passionately following their dreams. There were many doubts as to whether they would even make it in South Korea, but they stayed focused on themselves and their love for music and for telling their stories and life struggles sincerely by writing and producing their own music. Now, they exceeded every one's expectations. And they are still becoming bigger and bigger. Yet they remain as humble and as hard working as ever. I resonate with their story and am constantly inspired by them to keep pursuing my dreams.

### This is how you feel by Loote
Another hard working group. I honestly love all of the duo's song.
