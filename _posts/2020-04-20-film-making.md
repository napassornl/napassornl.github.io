After graduation, I wanted to explore my interests in filmmaking. I was always interested in how color and sounds can influence what we see and feel. 
Adding music over what I see imbues the most ordinary scenes with something so meaningful and more worthy of cherishing. Changing the color and tone of scenes
can tell so much about the emotions of that moment more than words can. I want to share with others how I see the world using these techniques. I started with
travel filmmaking from Chicago, Washington D.C., to Thailand. My latest video is from Tokyo, Japan!
