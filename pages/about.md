title: About Me
---

I was born in {{ 'Nonthaburi, Thailand' | link_to: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonthaburi_Province'}}. When I was almost 3 years old, I journey on a trip half way around the world to the United States, so I can support my dad in pursuing his doctoral degree in Computer Engineering. Me, mom, and dad lived in Miami, Florida for almost 8 years. When my dad received his Ph.D, we came back to Thailand. I graduated from Kasetsart University Laboratory School and got accepted to Boston University, College of Engineering. I initially pursued a Biomedical Engineering major, but through computer programming classes, I discovered that coding was way more fun. I started coding much later and took on my second major, Computer Engineering, half way through my junior year. I might be not as experienced in coding, but I have so much passion and enthusiasm for learning new technologies that I wil never give up on becoming a greater coder.
