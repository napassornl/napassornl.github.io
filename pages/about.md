title: About Me
---

I was born in Nonthaburi, Thailand. I graduated from high school in Thailand and attended Boston University from 2014 to 2018. I graduated with a double major in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Engineering. Though I got accepted to Stanford University's Master's program in Computer Science in the same year, I chose to accept a Software Development Engineer Position at Hitach Vantara.   

I chose this path because I believe this position will help be not only learn to implement my knowledge from college to real world engineering problems but also enhanced the skills of a great software engineer. I chose the career path because with some experience in the industry I will have developed some new perspectives in computer and technology by the time I decide to pursue a higher education.   

Mostly importantly, from this experience, I hope to figure who I am and what my dreams really are. My journey is just beginning! Though I might get stuck or feel overwhelmed at times, I know that I can also do anything if I set my mind to it. I will work hard and never lose my dreams!
