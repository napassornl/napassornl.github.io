![Me]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/nyc.jpg)

I was born in Nonthaburi, Thailand. When I was almost 3 years old, I journey on a trip half way around the world to the United States, so that I can support my dad in pursuing a doctoral degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Miami. Me, mom, and dad lived in Miami, Florida for almost 8 years and I went to school at Pinecrest Elementary School. When my dad received his Ph.D, we came back to Thailand and went to Kasetsart University Laboratory School. By the time I graduated from high school, I got accepted to Boston University, College of Engineering. This is the second time, I came back to the US. I initially pursued Biomedical Engineering, but I always felt that something was missing. Due to a health problem that's no longer an issue, it took me a while to discover that I have a passion for coding and logic and the aestheticism of programming semantics. So, I took on my second major, Computer Engineering, half way through my junior year. I might be not as experienced in coding, but I have so much passion and enthusiasm for learning new technologies that I wil never give up on becoming a greater coder. I knew learning to code from college courses was not enough so I learned most languages on my own and made some neat projects!
